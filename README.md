#Welcome to the Gabor's solution for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course assignment

##Files:

*run_analysis.R* contains code to read, tidy up the data, merge it into a new dataset , and then export the dataset into a textfile (please see dataset export file name below). run_analysis.R can be run directly from your R environment, as long as you have the original dataset in *[your working directory]/data folder*.

The output from the R script will have the file name *Tidy_dataset.txt*, and be put in your working directory. You can also find it in this GitHub repository.

Please also see the *code_book.rd* file for further information on the data.
